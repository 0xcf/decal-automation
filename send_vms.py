        Hi {username},

        Your student virtual machine for the Linux SysAdmin Decal is ready. You will need this machine to complete some of your labs. Please note the following login information:

        Host: {username}.decal.xcf.sh
        Username: {username}
        Temporary Password: {password}

        If you're not on eduroam you'll need to use the Berkeley VPN to connect to your VM: https://security.berkeley.edu/services/bsecure/bsecure-remote-access-vpn

        You can login to this machine with `ssh {username}@{hostname}`, after which youâ€™ll be prompted to enter your password. You should see a prompt to change your temporary password after your first login. We recommend selecting a strong password to secure your VM appropriately.

        If you have any questions or issues logging in (notably permission denied: publickey or port 22: connection refused), please make a private post on Ed with your OCF username.

        Linux SysAdmin DeCal Staff
